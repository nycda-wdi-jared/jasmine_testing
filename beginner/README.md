# Testing your code with Jasmine 

* Front page: https://jasmine.github.io/index.html
* Getting started with node.js: https://jasmine.github.io/pages/getting_started.html
* Using matchers: https://jasmine.github.io/api/edge/matchers.html

<h2>Notes</h2>

* Jasmine looks for a *.spec.js file, look in the spec/support/jasmine.json.
* Look in the package.json for the test script. When you run npm test, it will run your tests.
	* Green dots show up if your tests pass
	* If your tests fail, you will get very direct errors
